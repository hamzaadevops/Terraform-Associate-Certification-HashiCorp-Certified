## Splat Expressions
Splat expressions are a shorthand for extracting values from lists of objects. They are particularly useful when working with resources that return a list of values, but you only want to extract specific attributes from each element.

### Syntax:
```hcl
resource_name[*].attribute
# [*] extracts the value of attribute from each item in the list.
```
### Example: Splat Expression to Get Public IPs of EC2 Instances
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count         = 3
  ami           = "ami-052efd3df9dad4825"  
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

output "instance_public_ips" {
  value = aws_instance.example[*].public_ip
}
```
### Explanation:
**aws_instance.example[*].public_ip:** The splat expression extracts the public_ip attribute from each of the aws_instance.example resources. This works because multiple instances are created due to the count = 3 argument.
The output will be a list of public IPs for all instances created by the aws_instance.example resource.
