## on_failure Behavior
The on_failure argument specifies what Terraform should do if the provisioner script fails. It can be set to continue, fail, or delete, which influences whether Terraform should proceed with other operations, stop execution, or delete the resource upon failure.

### Syntax:
```hcl
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "command_that_might_fail"
  ]

  on_failure = "continue"  # Options are "continue", "fail", or "delete"
}
```
### Options:
- **continue:** Terraform will continue with the next operations even if the provisioner fails.
- **fail:** Terraform will stop execution and report a failure if the provisioner fails.
- **delete:** Terraform will delete the resource if the provisioner fails.

### Example:
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"  # Replace with a valid AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
    ]

    connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
      host        = self.public_ip
    }

    on_failure = "delete"  # Delete the instance if provisioning fails
  }
}
```
